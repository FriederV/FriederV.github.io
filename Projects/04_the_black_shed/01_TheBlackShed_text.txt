The Black Shed Project 
2020-2021

Design, Research, Education

The Black Shed is a project to refurbish an existing rural workshop space into a low-cost, environmentally-sustainable, self-build home in the Lake District National Park. The shed is located at Lawson Park, the base of Grizedale Arts rural residential arts programme, and will provide additional, self-contained and adaptable accommodation for curators and artists with dependants or access needs. 

The process of refurbishment will be approached as educational opportunity: it will be built by local women through a series of workshops, addressing the gender imbalance and accessibility of the construction industry through teaching craft and construction skills. It will also provide a demonstrator project for creative practices of self-building and sustainable development in the local area, responding to the lack of affordable and accessible housing for young people in the National Park. 

The project to date has involved a practical research phase, a series of design and construction workshops that fed into a design proposal, currently at planning stage. 

Project in partnership with Grizedale Arts, in collaboration with Karina Armanda (Kuznecova) and Choon Yuan Wang. With support from Foyle Foundation, Great Place, Lakes and Dales, and Arts Council England.

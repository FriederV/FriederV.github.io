Convivial Construction
2023
Theoretical/University/Student project

Our concept of the circular economy is anthropocentric, aiming to “keep products, materials and components at their highest value at all times” (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2019) without questioning the value system we are conforming to. When matter is no longer useful for humans it is degraded, it is called “leakage”, with no consideration for the possible benefit or opportunity to other ecological cycles within our material flow.

This project makes a productive critique of the ‘circular economy’ by proposing an alternative material culture that recognises the built environment as an extension of the wider ecosystem and social (cultural, economic, political) content. The role of the designer shifts to work between the architecture, and the landscape that produces and is produced by that architecture. This demands a technical and locally-specific understanding of the time-scale and availability of materials, and the ecological conditions they affect outside of our human frame of reference.

I propose this as a Convivial Construction practice - where conviviality is the building of of long-lasting, engaging and open ended relationships with non-humans and ecologies (Büscher & Fletcher, 2019).

Found and Foraged building systems

What can we build with? 
A 5-week residency with Grizedale Arts at The Farmers Arms followed a process of unlearning my expectations of what materials have a place in contemporary construction.

Working closely with the resident chef in the pub-kitchen during this time, my practice responded to the way I observed her exploring the (edible) potential of a landscape by being present in the landscape, touching, tasting and interacting with it in a curious and caring way. 

Using a tactile, hands-on approach to rediscover the available material landscape of the Lake District and its potential construction properties, I developed a series of prototypes for Wattle-and-Daub wall panels - a system designed to adapt a vernacular way of building to contemporary construction culture. My â€˜recipes' reworked traditional Daub mixtures to work with found, foraged and waste material from the local landscape and by-products of the pub. eg. could used chip oil add extra binding where soil clay-content is low? Could weaving invasive bracken give wattle surface? The residency culminated in an open workshop session on Wattle and Daub construction at the Lowick Village Show 2022. 

The Farmers Arms is a historic public house on the edge of the Lake District, currently being developed by local arts organisation Grizedale Arts around a focus of craft, community and experimental production, to rethink the role of the pub in contemporary British culture.

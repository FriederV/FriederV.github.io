\f0\fs24 \cf0 \'91Demolition or (de)construction\'92  was an exhibition at the break of an involuntary letting go. In the week after, the last inhabitants (that was us, too) left Chemistry. It was our last chance to open its doors before the demolishers would come in. It tried to show anyone involved with or interested in this place what was about to disappear. That means not just the concrete, bricks and gardens, but with it the latent potential for things new this place was still beaming with. It also was our chance to reach out beyond the academic refrain of the project, inviting neighbours, former chemists and others.\
In the old library we set out 1:33 fragment models at eye-height that described both the typical and exceptional moments in the building. Around it, four \'91lenses\'92 (after Guattari\'92s three ecologies) deconstructed our immersed view of the capacities these spaces still held. Above it, the empty bookshelves were a looming reminder of time and end.}
